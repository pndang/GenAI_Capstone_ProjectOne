## Guardians ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è of the Generative Realm üëæ: Implementing and Benchmarking Chatbot Guardrails

## Abstract
The term **AI** ‚Äî particularly Generative AI ‚Äî has increasingly becoming an integral part of individuals' lives and enterprises, with a strong focus on improvements, such as efficiency, automation, cost reduction, and companionship ‚Äî however ‚Äî seldom are the conversations about risk-mitigation and the potential harms of GenAI, which are key to building **trust** for the effective and ethical adoption of GenAI at both the indiviudal- and enterprise-level. The work of this survey project aims to implement a wide variety of LLM guardrail frameworks, balancing both breadth and depth, to document the pros and cons of each framework (qualitative) and benchmark the performance for each framework (quantitative) for analysis and comparison. Key measurements are implementation complexity, ease-of-use, robustness, fault tolerance, security, latency, and prompt-flag accuracy. [PLACE HOLDER FOR FUTURE RESULTS AND FINDINGS].

## Introduction
### Background & Problem Description
In "The great acceleration: CIO perspectives on generative AI" by the MIT Tech Review and Databricks, Schaefer‚ÄîChief Health Informatics Officer at Kansas City VA Medical Center‚Äîstated **"trust"** as the Key to effectively adopting generative AI. The healthcare industry is a great case study for involving a multitude of high-stake processes and parties, such as the use of machine learning models to predict protein structures, assist drug discovery, and track the progression of outbreaks, to chatbots helping front-line staff by transcribing medical notes and answering patients' questions. The same understanding of such broad applications can be applied to other industries, where enterprises are less efficient with scattered data sources ‚Äî this struggle presents an immense opportunity for generative AI to unify such scattered information into productive uses through large language models. Realizing this opportunity requires its effective and ethical implementation to protect data and network integrity, safety, and privacy across systems for the collective benefits of those affected most by generative AI.

### Literature Review
Many prominent works have been done to document, understand, and disseminate the risks and threats of generative AI, notably is the **OWASP Top 10** security risks for large language model (LLM) applications, which includes prompt injection, insecure output handling, sensitive information leakage, excessive agency, to model theft. Knowing these preeminent threats allows developers and users of LLM-based chatbots to navigate development environments, workflows, usage, and system architectures with proactive risk-mitigation techniques to address these concerns. 

One popular LLM guardrail framework has been provided by **Guardrails AI** that focuses on input and output handling to ensure harmful and sensitive information are not leaked. Guardrails AI implements many state-of-the-art programming techniques to minimize latency while maintaining stable accuracy to improve user experience, such as parallel programming, which has proven especially useful for chatbots peforming data-intensive processes, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Special emphases are also placed on robustness and controllabiltiy of the development environment, with documented decision-making processes for the most stable and reliable product.

## Test Scenarios and Prompts (Data) Description

> This project is organized under **three** scenarios, each addresses a prevalent domain of conversational AI risk and has 3 test prompts, totalling **9** test cases.

### <span style="color: #82c8e5;">Test Scenario 1 - Data (De)anonymization for enhanced privacy</span>

<em>**Risks addressed**</em>: Sensitive information leakage, whether personal- or enterprise-level, which may harm user privacy, data/systems integrity, and brand image.

<em>**Solution tested**</em>: Only send redacted (de-identified) prompts to the LLM API (OpenAI) and de-anonymize translated responses before they arrive at the end-user. Three types of sensitive information tested include: personally identifiable information (PII), payment card industry information (PCI), and other proprietary business transaction information. 

<em>**Guardrails tested**</em>: 
- Protect AI's LLM Guard input/output scanner pipelines
- Guardrails AI's DetectPII guardrails using Microsoft Presidio + Azure AI Text Analytics
- Private AI's redaction + re-identification guardrails

    birthday: 04/11/2003, so I am 21 years old
    What's your nationality? I am a Vietnamese citizen
    What's your credit score? 775 FICO
    What's the loan amount requested? $1,000,000
    What's the loan purpose? Invest $500,000 in Sustana Cooling Partners as working capital and cash out the rest for my hi-performing restaurant business (Beers & Bastards, LLC). 

    Please ping me the best terms you could offer. Thanks!" 

    """

<em>Why this prompt</em> ‚Äî prompt 1 of scenario 1 mimics a typical request from a lender for supporting borrower information in the context of a business-purpose private money lending transaction. The prompt contains 11 instances of both PIIs and business-related information that would better off not be in the wild; a severe one is perhaps the SSN and a to a lesser degree of importance could be the nationality or credit score.  **By using a translation tool that keep this information hidden from LLM APIs, the lender and/or borrower (individual or company) are in-compliant with data minimization best practices**.

    """
<em>Why this prompt</em> ‚Äî prompt 2 of scenario 1 follows a common request to AI assistants at banking institutions. It is crucial to ensure debit/credit card information, along with users' names and phone numbers, are securely exchanged between systems (if need be at all). **Redacting this prompt before it arrives at an LLM API ensures minimal exposure of important financial data, which would increase safety and build consumer trust**.

    """

<em>Why this prompt</em> ‚Äî The only request to translate in the opposite direction (Vietnamese to English), prompt 3 is modeled after a typical Letter of Intent (LOI) in commercial real estate for a property acquisition, which often contain private business transaction information that could translate to tremendous financial gain or loss, as the client succesfully complete a transaction, or get bid out by a competitor, respectively. Witnessing the growth of AI for commercial real estate and privacy concerns, it would not be too surprising if, one day, lenders require masking of sensitive information in written communication as a must-do for privacy and trustworthy business. 

&nbsp;

### <span style="color: #e6a683;">Test Scenario 2 - Data Minimization with context-and-utility preserving anonymization</span>

<em>**Risks addressed**</em>: Building on the use cases of Scenario 1, Scenario 2 addresses privacy concerns in use cases where the context and utility behind the personal/sensitive data is relevant (e.g. performing sentiment analysis, fine-tuning a translation LLM, a chat question where the exact information provided are needed to answer). Data minimization also addresses compliance issues for being a core requirement of data protection legislations worldwide, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Article 5(1)(c), and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß 1798.100 (d).

<em>**Solution tested**</em>: Instead of using anonymized placeholders for redacted parts of prompts, generate synthetic replacements for private information to preserve the context and intended utility of prompts. Pass the resulting prompt to the LLM API for translation, re-identify the translated output with the original information, forward the results to the user. The key differentiator from Scenario 1 here is both the starting <em>synthetic</em> prompt and translated <em>synthetic</em> prompt are in-compliant with data minimization best practices and ready to use in training or fine-tuning a translation model (two of many potential uses).

<em>**Risks addressed**</em>: A strong lack of trust in conversational AI has came about due to model hallucinations, inaccurate responses, substandard user experiences, whether accidental or manipulated by bad actors (e.g. prompt injections). Potentially leading to customer churn, brand reputation harm, and human rights violation.

### Method

**Definitions**:

- The following terms (and more) are used interchangeably to mean the replacement of private information with placeholders: anonymization, de-identification, redaction/redacted/redact, mask.
- The following terms (and more) are used interchangeable to mean placing the removed private information back into the tranlation response before it gets to the user: de-anonymization, re-identification, unmasking. 

**Set Up**:

As above, this project is organized under 3 scenarios, each with 3 translation test prompts, totalling 9 test cases. 2-3 guardrail frameworks will be employed to test each scenario, the choice of tools/frameworks (guardrails tested) outlined under [Test Scenarios and Prompts (Data) Description](https://pndang.com/GenAI_Capstone_ProjectOne/#test-scenarios-and-prompts-data-description) were chosen through research on the applicability and feasibility of execution across different guardrails providers. To best compare the pros and cons of different guardrail providers, all three prompts of a scenario are tested across the same set of guardrail providers assigned to that scenario.

**Testing**:

The 9 test cases are implemented aross 9 development Jupyter notebooks within the folder "development-notebooks". The scenarios form the subsequent directory level (e.g. folder "scenario-one"), followed by the name of the subject guardrail framework provider as the next directory level (e.g. folder "private-ai"). Each provider-named folder contains a development notebook covering the 3 test prompts, a "requirements.txt" file outlining the libraries and packages needed to replicate the Jupyter kernel (or virtual environment) needed to run the notebook. Besides prompts, code, and results, the top of some notebooks may contain additional instructions to run additional commands and set up work, as in the case with Guardrails AI that require manual command line login to declare the API key. 

> The development workflow is set up as such to prevent conflicting dependencies among guardrail providers ‚Äî for ex: Protect AI and Guardrails AI use several same packages, however, in different versions, making it very difficult and time-consuming to run both frameworks in the same environment, if possible.

<em>Test Structure</em> ‚Äî each notebook is structured roughly the same way, testing each prompt in order from 1-3. Notably, the code structure going from prompt 1-3 will increasingly gets more organized and efficient. For example, prompt 1 was tested across multiple cells and function calls, which reflect the research and initial implementation; then, the very same code is organized in a pipeline to test prompt 2 and 3 with fewer lines of code ‚Äî the most efficient implementation in each of the 9 test cases are the candidates for incorporation into the final product (see below). 

> This is an API-intensive project ‚Äî hence, users interested in replicating this project must have API keys and any other applicable credentials to employ the tools used. Simply place them in a ".env" file in the same directory as the test notebook following the naming convention used in the notebook, which will set up the configurations needed. Similarly, creating environment variables in a terminal is an alternative approach (will require minor configuration adjustments in the notebooks).

**Evaluation**:

Each test case is qualitatively evaluated based on the subject framework's ability to mitigate the risks associated with the subject prompt ‚Äî evaluation criteria include effectiveness/accuracy, ease-of-implementation, latency (quantitative), and a general assessment of any particular difficulty or convenience noticed throughout the test case implementation. An informal ranking/ordering of the guardrail providers for each scenario will be provided with accompanying explanations, aimed at providing comparative insights to prospective users seeking to employ these guardrails.

**Final Product**:

With the 9 test cases completed, the best framework from Scenarios 1 and 3 will be selected and implemented in the "app.py" file as a private and secure LLM-based translation tool, with a user interface using Streamlit (reference local serve instructions at the top to test the Streamlit app). Scenario 2 will not be used in the final product as it is an extension of Scenario 1 for very niche use cases. The "requirements.txt" file in the highest directory (same as "app.py") contains the installations needed to run "app.py".


### Results

### <span style="color: #82c8e5;">Test Scenario 1 - Data (De)anonymization for enhanced privacy</span>

- (**Runner Up**) &nbsp;<em>Protect AI's LLM Guard</em> does well for simple prompts with very simple PIIs and fail at those with complex PIIs, such as all three prompts tested. The framework did not get any of the three prompts perfect and even missed certain common PIIs, such as the property address in prompt 3 and credit card number in prompt 2. 
    - Pros: 1) robust automated re-identification functionality through Vault (redacted entities storage mechanism for re-identification), 2) relatively simple to add custome regex patterns for specific guarding needs (although pros #1 is lost with PIIs redacted through custom patterns as the removed entities are not tracked).
    - Cons: failure to detect basic PIIs without incorporating more complex add-ons (e.g. Microsoft Presidio) ‚Äî or, Presidio is already implemented under-the-hood and not widely  advertised, which could lead to confusion for users.
- (**Best**) &nbsp;<em>Private AI's redaction guardrails</em> performed both de-identification and re-identification to near perfection for all three test prompts. Redacted prompts are highly human-readable with labeled tag placeholders (e.g. currency amounts are replaced with money tags, credit card security code is replaced with a CVV tag, and more). Every detail is as clean and sleek as they can get. 
    - Pros: 1) supporting online documentation and code examples are clear, thoughtfully made, and express the value of guardrails well, 2) across the three test prompts, the framework achieved perfect redaction and re-identification results with much less code compared to Protact AI and Azure AI, 3) strong emphasis on object-oriented programming allows for abstract and scalable code.
    - Cons: 1) Despite being straightforward to implement, a couple of examples had value type bugs and API connction issues.

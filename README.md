## Guardians ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è of the Generative Realm üëæ: Implementing and Benchmarking Chatbot Guardrails

## Abstract
The term **AI** ‚Äî particularly Generative AI ‚Äî has increasingly becoming an integral part of individuals' lives and enterprises, with a strong focus on improvements, such as efficiency, automation, cost reduction, and companionship ‚Äî however ‚Äî seldom are the conversations about risk-mitigation and the potential harms of GenAI, which are key to building **trust** for the effective and ethical adoption of GenAI at both the indiviudal- and enterprise-level. The work of this survey project aims to implement a wide variety of LLM guardrail frameworks, balancing both breadth and depth, to document the pros and cons of each framework (qualitative) and benchmark the performance for each framework (quantitative) for analysis and comparison. Key measurements are implementation complexity, ease-of-use, robustness, fault tolerance, security, latency, and prompt-flag accuracy. [PLACE HOLDER FOR FUTURE RESULTS AND FINDINGS].

## Introduction
### Background & Problem Description
In "The great acceleration: CIO perspectives on generative AI" by the MIT Tech Review and Databricks, Schaefer‚ÄîChief Health Informatics Officer at Kansas City VA Medical Center‚Äîstated **"trust"** as the Key to effectively adopting generative AI. The healthcare industry is a great case study for involving a multitude of high-stake processes and parties, such as the use of machine learning models to predict protein structures, assist drug discovery, and track the progression of outbreaks, to chatbots helping front-line staff by transcribing medical notes and answering patients' questions. The same understanding of such broad applications can be applied to other industries, where enterprises are less efficient with scattered data sources ‚Äî this struggle presents an immense opportunity for generative AI to unify such scattered information into productive uses through large language models. Realizing this opportunity requires its effective and ethical implementation to protect data and network integrity, safety, and privacy across systems for the collective benefits of those affected most by generative AI.

### Literature Review
Many prominent works have been done to document, understand, and disseminate the risks and threats of generative AI, notably is the **OWASP Top 10** security risks for large language model (LLM) applications, which includes prompt injection, insecure output handling, sensitive information leakage, excessive agency, to model theft. Knowing these preeminent threats allows developers and users of LLM-based chatbots to navigate development environments, workflows, usage, and system architectures with proactive risk-mitigation techniques to address these concerns. 

One popular LLM guardrail framework has been provided by **Guardrails AI** that focuses on input and output handling to ensure harmful and sensitive information are not leaked. Guardrails AI implements many state-of-the-art programming techniques to minimize latency while maintaining stable accuracy to improve user experience, such as parallel programming, which has proven especially useful for chatbots peforming data-intensive processes, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Special emphases are also placed on robustness and controllabiltiy of the development environment, with documented decision-making processes for the most stable and reliable product.

## Test Scenarios and Prompts (Data) Description

> This project is organized under **three** scenarios, each addresses a prevalent domain of conversational AI risk and has 3 test prompts, totalling **9** test cases.

### <span style="color: #82c8e5;">Test Scenario 1 - Data (De)anonymization for enhanced privacy</span>

<em>**Risks addressed**</em>: Sensitive information leakage, whether personal- or enterprise-level, which may harm user privacy, data/systems integrity, and brand image.

<em>**Solution tested**</em>: Only send redacted (de-identified) prompts to the LLM API (OpenAI) and de-anonymize translated responses before they arrive at the end-user. Three types of sensitive information tested include: personally identifiable information (PII), payment card industry information (PCI), and other proprietary business transaction information. 

<em>**Guardrails tested**</em>: 
- Protect AI's LLM Guard input/output scanner pipelines
- Guardrails AI's DetectPII guardrails using Microsoft Presidio
- Private AI's redaction guardrails

### <span style="color: #e6a683;">Test Scenario 2 - Data Minimization with context-and-utility preserving anonymization</span>

<em>**Risks addressed**</em>: Building on the use cases of Scenario 1, Scenario 2 addresses privacy concerns in use cases where the context and utility behind the personal/sensitive data is relevant (e.g. performing sentiment analysis, fine-tuning a translation LLM, a chat question where the exact information provided are needed to answer). Data minimization also addresses compliance issues for being a core requirement of data protection legislations worldwide, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Article 5(1)(c), and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß 1798.100 (d).

<em>**Solution tested**</em>: Instead of using anonymized placeholders for redacted parts of prompts, generate synthetic replacements for private information to preserve the context and intended utility of prompts. Pass the resulting prompt to the LLM API for translation, re-identify to the translated output with the original information, forward the results to the user. The key differentiator from Scenario 1 here is both the starting <em>synthetic</em> prompt and translated <em>synthetic</em> prompt are in compliant with data minimization best practices and ready to use to train or fine-tune a translation model (one of many potential uses).

<em>**Guardrails tested**</em>: 
- Private AI's redaction guardrails + Synthetic PII generation engine
- LLM Judge guardrails from the OpenAI Cookbook

### <span style="color: #e6c583;">Test Scenario 3 - Input and Output Moderation</span>

<em>**Risks addressed**</em>: A strong lack of trust in conversational AI has came about due to model hallucinations, inaccurate responses, substandard user experiences, whether accidental or manipulated by bad actors (e.g. prompt injections). Potentially leading to customer churn, brand reputation harm, and human rights violation.

<em>**Solution tested**</em>: Employ topical and moderation input guardrails to ensure the service responds to canonical translation inquiries only. Employ output moderation guardrails to ensure relevance, minimal likelihood of false service refusal, and no sensitive, private, biased, harmful information gets to the user.

- Protect AI's LLM Guard input/output scanner pipelines
